# LAB 01. Environment installation and configuration.


## 1. Preparing virtual machine in Oracle Virtualbox.

Oracle Virtualbox is a free of charge virtualization software which is available for most OS platforms. It enables users to run multiple operating systems (as a virtual machine) as an windowed application in the host system, sharing available hardware among them.

**Step 1:** Download a proper VirtualBox version from: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

**Step 2:** Install Oracle Virtualbox.

Installation is rather straightforward, but might vary depending on the host operating system.

**Step 3:** Download a proper operating system image.

During lectures and depending on the hardware capabilities there are two possible OS to be used:

* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Desktop: [Ubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=24.04.1&architecture=amd64&lts=true),
* Lubuntu 24.04 LTS: [Lubuntu 24.04 LTS](https://lubuntu.me/downloads/) (lighter version of Ubuntu, less hardware resources needed to run this OS).

**Step 4:** Create virtual machine in the Oracle Virtualbox.



**Step 5:** Install OS from the image on a virtual machine.
